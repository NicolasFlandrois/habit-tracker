My Habit Tracker

# Description

The goal of this project is to build an "Habits Tracker" app, minimalist and yet complete.
For now, this is gona be a local app, for single user data.

## My approach:

- Instead of being dicted on how to build it from the famework or the tools, I first study the needs.
- Step 1: Defining the relationship database.
	- How much minimalist can I go?
	- What is a habit tracker? Really?
	- What Should I track?
	- What data do I need?
	- create a database to reflect those criteria.
- step 2: Test the database. 
	- In SQL start tracking habits, directly in the database.
	- Create a simple web data viewer. (Jupyter notebook)
	- Does this ERD/Schema match what we need?
	- Is it sufficiant? Easy to use? Complete enough?
	- Are the data exploitable? 
- Step 3: Build a mobile app.

## My Criteria/features:

- Can track anything I want (config/setup).
- Tracking:
	- Datetime (When I recorded this habit)
	- What? What Habit?
	- Quantity? (how to define what unit to use?)
	- Some comments?
